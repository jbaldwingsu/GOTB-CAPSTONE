How to use emailsummary.py:

go to myaccount.google.com/apppasswords and generate a password code to be used with python API's
on line 7, for "sender" enter in your gmail you just used to generate the passcode
fill out the recipients you want to send the email to
on line 9, for "password = " enter the passcode you just generated
make sure all these fields are entered inside of quotes! ("...")
Now, when you terminate packetcapture.py, the terminal should print "Summary email sent to _", and you will receive an email summary to the recipient specified.
